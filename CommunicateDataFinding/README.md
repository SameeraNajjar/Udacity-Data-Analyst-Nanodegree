  ###  Borrower APR, Prosper Rating, and Loan Status:
   Borrowers with high credit ratings (AA and A) generally had lower APRs, and their loans were more likely to be "Current" or "Completed."
        Loans that were "Chargedoff" tended to have higher APRs across all ratings, suggesting that higher APRs could be associated with greater risk or borrower financial strain.
       

   ### Debt-to-Income Ratio, Prosper Rating, and Loan Status:
    Loans with a high Debt-to-Income Ratio were more prone to default ("Chargedoff") or show other delinquent statuses, especially among lower Prosper Ratings.
        Higher-rated borrowers tended to have lower Debt-to-Income Ratios, indicating financial stability and lower risk levels.

   
       
   ### Loan Original Amount, Borrower APR, and Prosper Rating:
     Larger loan amounts were associated with lower APRs, particularly among borrowers with higher Prosper Ratings, indicating lenders' confidence in creditworthy borrowers.
        Lower-rated borrowers not only faced higher APRs but also showed wider APR variability even for similar loan amounts, reflecting stricter lending conditions.
